# PDFViewerEnhanced
PDFViewerEnhanced is a Chrome extension for reading PDFs, an improvement of the classic [PDF Viewer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pdf-viewer/oemmndcbldboiebfnladdacbdfmadadm?hl=en) extension with more than 1 million users.

Built on top of the original source code, the enhanced version provides additional features:
- Bold rendering, makes the reading experience pleasant when fonts are too light
- Customizable shortcuts (Beta)
- Instant zoom, it zooms when you scroll zoom, no delay at all!

***
## MOTIVATION
The original version was great, even before the enhancement it provided a much better experience than Adobe Acrobat Reader, but it has a few shortcomings:
- Zoom delay, when zooming with mouse, it takes a few seconds to respond to changes rather than instantly
- Unable to make fonts bold, hard to read with thin fonts
- No customizable shortcuts
